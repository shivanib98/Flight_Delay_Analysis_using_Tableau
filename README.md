# Flight_Delay_Analysis_using_Tableau
Conducted a Flight delay analysis using Tableau for visualisation

<p align="justify">To understand the root cause of aircraft delays, we developed a Decision Support System (DSS), which analyses the flight data and offers information about delays. This DSS's goal is to offer information to stakeholders that will enable them to make wise decisions about infrastructure planning, flight operations, and scheduling. We set out to provide answers to important issues, such as what delays are caused by, how long they last on average, if they are seasonal, how long each airline delays departure relative to the destination, and which airport experiences the most delays. We also did a narrowed-down analysis on airlines, airports, types of delays, and time of delays.</p>
